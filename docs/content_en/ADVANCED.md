## 🧰 1. Understanding "Tools"

Hikari doesn't know how to do everything by herself. She uses "Tools" to extend her capabilities. When the AI responds in a JSON format containing a `tool` field, the bot interrupts the text response and executes a programmed function.

### The Technical Flow:
1.  **Declaration:** The tool is described in the `src/data/mcp_tools.json` file.
2.  **Identification:** The AI receives these descriptions in the System Prompt.
3.  **Execution:** `llmHandler.js` intercepts the JSON, executes the logic in Node.js (e.g., `performWebSearch`), and returns the result to the AI to finalize the response.

## 🤖 2. Enhanced Native Tools (MCP)

Hikari's MCP ecosystem has been robustly enhanced with specific native behaviors:

### 1. Currency & Finance (`convert_currency`)
- **Error Resilience:** The MCP has been upgraded to handle rate limits and financial API failures. If the main API fails, a fallback exchange rate is used.
- **Daily Cache:** The system saves a daily conversion table in a local JSON file, preventing unnecessary requests for frequent currencies.

### 2. Game Search (`search_game`)
- **Linguistic Flexibility:** If the searched game name fails in the FitGirl/DODI database, the AI attempts to search for slightly different names or spelling variations.
- **List Embed:** The tool can return an interactive list of found games, allowing the AI to present a selection for the user to choose from instead of directly sending the Torrent file.

### 3. Image Generation (`image_gen`)
- **Transparency on Limitations:** The AI is now instructed to refuse requests to edit existing images and make it clear that she does not possess native computer vision in real-time.

### 4. Media Downloader (`download_video`, `download_audio` & `search_and_download_music`)
- **Smart Direction:** The AI identifies the user's intent to download video or audio. If the request is ambiguous, the AI asks clarification questions in chat instead of blindly triggering the tool. The MCP does not start compression processes; that decision is handled by Discord limits and the user via buttons.
- **Music Search & Download (`search_and_download_music`):** Allows the AI to search and download HQ MP3 tracks directly from Deezer via `deemix`. If confidence score is high (>=80%), it downloads immediately; if ambiguous, it presents a 5-track text list alongside an interactive selection dropdown menu for the user.

### 5. Permanent AI Database (`database_read`, `database_write`, `database_delete`)
- **Autonomous Memory Architecture:** Instead of stuffing mass context into the System Prompt, the AI autonomously determines when to read or persist records in `src/data/ai_database.json`.
- **Read & List (`database_read`):** Reads a specific key or lists all available database keys when no key argument is passed.
- **Write & Update (`database_write`):** Saves strings or structured objects. Automatically updates `updatedAt` and preserves existing `protected` flags.
- **Protected Record Safeguards (`database_delete`):** Prevents deletion of records marked with `protected: true` unless executed by the Bot Owner (`isOwner`).
- **Runtime Enforcements:** All operations validate granular flags (`aiDbReadEnabled`, `aiDbWriteEnabled`, `aiDbDeleteEnabled`) in `databaseHandler.js` before interacting with the local JSON file.

## 📂 3. How to create a new Tool?

### Step 1: Define in JSON
Add a new object in `src/data/mcp_tools.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "my_command",
    "description": "Explanation for the AI to know when to use it.",
    "parameters": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Implement in the Handler
In the `src/handlers/llmHandler.js` file, add the execution logic inside the `processQueue()` function or create a specific handler. Make sure to handle errors so the AI doesn't get "stuck" waiting for a response.

## 🏗️ 4. Customizing the Soul (System Prompt)

Hikari's personality is not just text; it's a set of safety and behavior guidelines.
- **Location:** `src/config/index.js` -> `systemPrompt` field.
- **Tip:** If you change the formatting rules (such as allowing emojis), remember that this can increase token consumption and change the "tone" of the conversations.

---

## 💡 Development Tips

- 💡 **Thought Trace Logs:** Watch the console. Hikari prints the AI's `"thought"` before each tool action. If it's "hallucinating", adjust the tool description in the JSON.
- 💡 **Permissions:** When creating tools that delete messages or manage roles, make sure the Bot has those permissions in Discord; otherwise, `discord.js` will throw a `Missing Permissions` error.
- 💡 **JSON Sanitization:** Always pass the AI's outputs through a `JSON.parse` filter if you're requesting structured logs, as smaller models can "leak" keys like `{"response": "..."}` in the middle of the text.
- 💡 **Internal Comments:** The bot uses recursive calls (`isInternalComment: true`) to generate natural speech after tool use, ensuring the AI always has a human "voice" after processing raw data.
- 💡 **Error Isolation:** Always use `try-catch` around new tools. A poorly implemented tool can bring down the entire bot process if not handled.
