## 💡 Expert Tips

- 💡 **Privacy First:** Use the `visibility: Private` parameter in the `/ia_chat` command to handle sensitive matters or avoid cluttering the chat with long AI texts.
- 💡 **Image Quality:** When using `/ia_imagem`, put effort into the `negative_prompt` with terms like `blurry, deformed, low quality` to force the AI to generate sharper results.
- 💡 **AI Diversity:** If an image provider is slow, try changing the `provider` manually. `Pollinations` is generally the most stable, while `Together` offers high-fidelity FLUX models.
- 💡 **Context History:** Hikari "remembers" the channel's latest messages. Use this to your advantage when asking for summaries or continuing a conversation without needing to repeat everything.
