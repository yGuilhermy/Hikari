### 🎀 What can I do? (Features)

I'm not just a common chat bot! I'm an **Autonomous Agent** capable of interacting with the real world to help you:

- **🧠 Advanced Brain**: Support for multiple models via **Gemini**, **LM Studio (Local)**, and **HuggingFace**. My personality is natural and adaptable!
- **🌍 Smart Search**: If I don't know something, I research it on the internet in real-time, read the websites, and bring you a summarized report.
- **🎵 Personal DJ & Radio Mode**: Download high-quality music tracks (Deezer HQ MP3) by song/artist name or stream interactive voice radio with 3 listening modes: zero-AI Alexa-style direct commands (`⚡ Direct`), generative assistant (`🧠 AI`), and `Off`.
- **🎮 Gaming Corner**: I look for torrents and magnets for games (Dodi/Fitgirl) and natively consult **Steam** for prices and technical details.
- **🎨 Art Studio**: I can generate amazing images using Stability AI or Pollinations. Just ask!
- **💱 Finance Master**: I convert currencies and cryptocurrencies (BTC, USD, BRL) in real-time with official quotes.
- **🎙️ Voice Assistant in Calls**: Join voice channels (`/entrar-call`) and talk to me by saying "Hikari". Natively supports Discord DAVE (E2EE) protocol.
- **🎙️ Audio Transcription in History**: Transcribes chat voice notes on-demand via Whisper (Wit.ai with Groq fallback), persistently caching transcriptions per message without redundant re-processing.
- **💾 Autonomous Permanent Memory & Database**: On-demand persistent database (Zero Token Overhead) with multi-topic aggregate search, author tracking (`salvo_por: "user - id"`), importance filtering (`important`), unauthorized modification/deletion locks, and security guards against bulk data dumps and harmful content.
- **🛡️ Silent Guardian**: Internal AutoMod system with automatic blocking of forbidden terms and appeal management.

### 🚀 How to wake me up (Installation)

#### ⚡ Fast Setup (Recommended)
For an automatic installation of all dependencies (Node.js, npm libraries, yt-dlp, and ffmpeg), use our setup scripts:

- **Windows:** Double-click the `setup.bat` file.
- **Linux:** Run `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`.

---

#### 🛠️ Manual Method
If you prefer to do everything yourself (Ubuntu/Linux recommended):

1.  **Clone my code**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yGuilhermy/Hikari.git
    cd Hikari
    ```

2.  **Install modules**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    _Note: You need `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` installed on your system for music functions to work properly!_

3.  **Configure my secrets**:
    - Rename `.env_example` to `.env` and fill in the keys.
    - **Tip:** You can change my name in `.env` by modifying `BOT_NAME`!

4.  **Start**:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
